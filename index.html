                <p>"Somewhere in the timeline,
                    Universe got paused,
                    It took a deep breath,
                    Cuz there was someone who was about to come.
                    Walls were listening.
                    The floor was all ears.
                    All of them were praying for a certain person.
                    Many came to see the moon that was about to rise.
                    A light gentle enough to heal
                    Yet powerful enough to outshine the sun.
                    Heavens leaned closer.
                    Witnessing the soul that was coming.
                    The creator of everything (Allah) heard the prayers before they were spoken.
                    Answered them before they got finished.
                    A Queen was born, crowned by destiny.
                    Coming with the blessings.
                    Her parents heart got honored.
                    Their patience got rewarded.
                    Got blessed beyond they can measure.
                    The Queen got a name by her parents and started being called "ROMAISA"
                    The name got beauty of its own.
                    Now imagine the one holding that name.

                    Her beauty is unmeasurable for me as a writer and as viewer I can only say it's heavenly and indeed
                    it is...

                    HER EYES are beautiful like the moon of 14th containg hope and full of charm.
                    The dazzling charm from her eyes is as glowing that stars always dwindle in thier Presence.
                    It's the eyes that can kill most of the humans just by a glance.
                    Her is is as white as the pure milk containing the brown citrine in it.
                    Whenever I see her eyes I feel like it's the most beautiful thing created by the the one and only
                    God.
                    My words gets dim in front of her eyes that's how pretty/lovely they are.

                    HER LIPS I'm so confused how should I even describe.
                    They are the lips that feels like coming straight out from a fairytale.
                    Whenever she laughs they looks so pure that I want to touch them not because of obsession but
                    because it feels like the thing that's descended from heaven.
                    They looks so adorable that I want to die by kissing them and making myself breathless.
                    They are as soft as the snow on the peakest mountain yet calm.
                    The joy of the youth that comes from them makes my day lively.
                    I can see them from the rest of my life without even seeing them.

                    HER CHEEKS are as soft as the talc.
                    Her cheeks feels like the cotton,sometimes like the fur of a cat.
                    The dimple around her cheeks whenever she smiles always had me dying.
                    The more I describe her cheeks the more I started blushing that's how cute they are.
                    The thought of touching her pure cheeks with my dirty hands can't be described with my ungrateful
                    words.

                    HER HANDS are not the part that belongs to one person.
                    They contains beauty that is otherworldly far beyond our imagination.
                    They are of pure white as much that the white colour feels like black in front of them.
                    They are the hands that I'll never leave behind even after dying.
                    I'll hold them in the afterlife,so she doesn't feel lonely.
                    I'll kiss them, treasure them, touch them, put them on my cheeks whenever I wanna feel relieved, pat
                    my head with them, cherish them and adore them for the eternity.

                    HER FEET as beautiful as the color of love.
                    Whenever he walks the soil beneath her feet got purified. The sound of her feet hitting the ground
                    makes the heart flutters. Seeing her feet and u will want to touch them once before dying.
                    But the moment you gonna thought of touching them u'll gonna find yourself in a doubt. The type of
                    doubt only pure can understand...

                    Today is not just a date.

                    Today is the day that arrived with barakah,
                    the day written with mercy,
                    the day beauty was entrusted to the earth.


                    January -6-2026


                    The birthday of the princess that's crowned with blessings.
                    The birthday of my love.
                    The birthday of the one whom I can sacrifice my life for.
                    The one that I will hold dear in every moment of my life.
                    The one I will choose at the day of judgement too.


                    Your birthday is not a reminder of age,
                    it’s a reminder of impact.
                    Of how many hearts breathe easier
                    because you are here.
                    The moon rose softer on the day you were born.
                    You came into this world without noise,
                    yet everything changed.
                    Today, I don’t wish you riches or perfection.
                    I wish you peace that stays.
                    The kind that follows you even in silence.
                    I wish your heart always feels understood,
                    even on days you don’t explain yourself.
                    May life treat you with the tenderness
                    you give to the world without realizing.
                    May your smile never feel like effort,
                    and your tears never feel lonely.
                    You deserve a happiness
                    that doesn’t rush,
                    doesn’t fade,
                    and doesn’t ask for reasons.
                    On your birthday,
                    I hope the universe returns
                    even half of the love
                    you quietly give.
                    I hope the world will feel the kindness
                    you're spreading quietly.
                    I wish u will always smile no matter the situation.
                    Your smile will become the power of your loved ones.
                    May Allah gives u the things u deserve
                    May Allah makes u the reason for your parents to go in Jannah.

                    And lastly I'm not a man with a great honor and pride nor I am as perfect as u are I'm not a man
                    with a great past.
                    I'm what I'm. Nothing just a low soul that likes to ask your hand from Allah in his every prayer.
                    Whenever I hold hands high in air the very first thought that comes in my mind is yours.
                    U are the reason my Salah is much better and so guud.
                    I was good for nothing before but u polished me into a fine man.
                    I got close to the Allah indeed he's close to everyone's heart but I started enjoying it holding
                    hands in air in front of him and the person who made it happened was non other than u my love so
                    these hands are always gonna say your name whenever they gonna held high.

                    And some lines for you my love I hope u will gonna like them...

                    I didn’t fall for you instantly,
                    I drowned into you slowly.
                    One thought at a time,
                    one heartbeat closer to yours.
                    You entered in my life like a quiet prayer,
                    And I got answered before I even asked.
                    Now my soul recognizes your presence,
                    before my eyes do.
                    Loving you feels ancient,
                    like my heart knew you before this life.
                    Maybe you were the one,
                    That always likes to come in my dreams.
                    As if we were written,
                    long before we met.
                    Your name lives softly on my tongue,
                    like a secret meant only for me.
                    Every time I think of you,
                    my heart lowers its guard.
                    You don’t just make me smile,
                    you make me feel safe enough to feel the moment.
                    In your existence,
                    I find rest.
                    I love the way you stay in my thoughts,
                    without asking for space.
                    Even silence brings you to me,
                    gently, lovingly.
                    Your eyes hold a depth,
                    I could drown in willingly.
                    Not to escape the life,
                    but to understand it better.
                    When you speak,
                    my heart listens first.
                    When you’re quiet,
                    my soul listens harder.
                    Loving you is not chaos,
                    it is calm with intensity.
                    A fire that doesn’t burn,
                    but warms everything it touches.
                    You make my flaws feel forgiven,
                    without ever mentioning them.
                    Doesn't matter how much I will say thanks,
                    It's never enough the things u have done for me.
                    You look at me like I’m enough,
                    and somehow—I become it.
                    I crave you in the softest way,
                    not possession, but obsession.
                    To sit beside you,
                    and feel complete.
                    If hearts had fingerprints around it,
                    Yours will be around mine.
                    Every beat carries you,
                    without permission.
                    I love you beyond words,
                    where languages comes to an end.
                    Where feelings exist,
                    raw and unfiltered.
                    You are my favorite vulnerability,
                    the risk I’d choose every time.
                    With you, love isn’t fear,
                    it’s trust.
                    Even distance bows to what I feel,
                    even time steps aside.
                    Because my heart doesn’t measure the love u carries,
                    it recognizes the moment u say it.
                    The saying that's as pretty as u the moment u said "I LOVE YOU".
                    I want you in my quiet moments,
                    not just my celebrations.
                    In my tired evenings,
                    and my hopeful mornings.
                    Loving you feels like returning,
                    not chasing.
                    Like my soul exhaling,
                    after a long journey.
                    I don’t want forever loudly,
                    I want it sincerely.
                    One day at a time,
                    hand in heart.
                    If love is a language,
                    you are my fluency.
                    I don’t struggle to feel you,
                    I exist in it.
                    You are my soft thought at night,
                    the warmth in my chest.
                    Even when the world is heavy,
                    you make me light.
                    I choose you in small ways,
                    every single day.
                    In patience, in loyalty,
                    in silence.
                    My love for you is not loud,
                    but it is endless.
                    It grows in depth,
                    not display.
                    If I ever lose words,
                    my heart will still speak your name.
                    Because you are not just someone I love,
                    you are someone I belong to.
                    You are written into my prayers,
                    my pauses, my hopes.
                    I don’t need the world to witness this,
                    my soul already knows.
                    This love is gentle,
                    deep, and true.
                    And if love has a destination,
                    it is you.
                    And there's a thing I wanna say so badly,
                    The word that got created jus for you
                    And the word is that "I LOVE YOU".
